# Todo

---

- [x] make tests for create_url
- [x]. Time to implement my test cases for the split_nodes in the test_helper at the bottom

3. Make a todo for what I should do

- Spend sometime thinking about what you want to do for the use of this stimulant

I enjoyed this chapter a lot because I got stuck in the portion of writting unit tests for a lot of it.

This was the first time I actually wanted to write some tests and didn't mind it.My only comment on this lesson is that there was a point where I wanted to test my program against unit tests that was written by the course instructor. I am also aware that the unit tests were all in the solutions file. We could always check there. But I believe there was a better opportunity to give the unit tests to the user in the form of a tip.

So in ch5 lesson 2 we generated our first html page.

Step 9 mentions: "Inspect the page in your browser, as well as the raw HTML output. If you wrote really good unit tests, its likely that everything worked as expected. If you see any errors, debug and fix them!"

Maybe here the unit tests written by the instructor could have been provided within the tips section.

If adding the unit test to this spot doesn't fit the objectives of this lesson, I still believe that the student would benefit and appreciate the unit tests to be given to them as a reward at the very end.

Something like:
"Good job on getting to this point. Here are the unit tests I wrote, see if your code passes all of my edge cases.

Bonus: Write edge_case.md -> missed edge cases in unit test

This could serve as a great way to reinforce the learner by getting them to go back
